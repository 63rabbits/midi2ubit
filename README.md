# midi2ubit

Convert MIDI notes to notes-string for micro:bit. The notes-string can be played using micro:bit extention [pxt-microbit-nerds](https://github.com/63rabbits/pxt-microbit-nerds).


## Note

The micro:bit only plays one note at a time, so it can't play chords. midi2ubit picks the highest note when it finds a chord.
